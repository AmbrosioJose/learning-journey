/**
 * Insertion sort
 *
 * Sorts a list of number in place in ascending order. Time complexity is O(n^2)
 * fun note: At every point i, a[0..i - 1] is called a loop invariant. The elements in a[0..i-1] are the same numbers,
 * but they are in sorted ascending order
 *
 * If the input list is in reverse order it is the worst case scenario. (n(n + 1)/ 2) - 2
 * If the input list is in sorted order then it is the best case which is linear
 *
 * @param a list that will be sorted
